# software_construction_lab1
1. Intro to good practices in software construction using C++ programming language in a Linux envirentment.
2. Create header directory for header files ".hpp": each class has its own .hpp file.
3. Create src directory for source files ".cpp": all source code files for each class in a separate .cpp file and a at least 1 program to run which includes a main function.
4. Introduction to CMake as a build system built on top of GNU's make and supports advanced features to build projects: 
    - Create a CMakeLists.txt file which CMake system looks for to know what to build for the project. 
    - Create a build directory where to run "cmake .." as Linux terminal command to build the project.
    - Run the Linux command "make" to execute the Makefile generated by CMake and create the executable programs of the project. 

## To run the project nicely run the following commands:
   '''
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   '''
## 3 executables are created, use one of the commands to run an executable:
    '''
    ./hello_world
    ./area_calculator
    ./standard_area_calculator
    '''
